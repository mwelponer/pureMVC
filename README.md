# test_puremvc #

## How to run it:
- windows -> simply run .bat
- linux/osx -> in the terminal type "java -jar testPuremvc-1.0.jar"

## What is it
The tool acts as a server listening for incoming (http rest) TCP messages on a
specific port, but it can also work as a client to send json messages
via TCP to other PCs connected to the network.

### Using the tool as a server
The very first time it runs the server listens on port 9000. You can change it
 using menu Edit > Change server port.
Inside the second textbox (the console) you will see incoming json messages.

You can use a free software like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to
send the message to the computer running the tool. After downloading Postman use the following settings inside Postman

- create a request: select POST, request url: theIpOfThePcRunningTestPuremvc:9000
- in the body tab select raw and write the json message
e.g. {"coordX": 0.111,"coordY": 6.666}
e.g. {"coords":[31117.4, 233488.7], "debugLevel": 0}
- in the last body tab Text change it to JSON
- send

You can also use the same tool in client mode (see below) to send messages to another PC where an instance of the same 
tool is acting as a server.

### Using the tool as a client
Let's say you are PCa (192.168.1.1) and you want to send a json message to
PCb (192.168.2.2) that is already running the tool on port 9000.

- Edit the first textbox with the json message you want to send, by default isÂ 
{"coords":[31117.4, 233488.7], "debugLevel": 0} but you can type whatever json file you want.
If the json contains both the objects 'coordX' and 'coordY' or the object 'coords', the server will
recognise them as coordinates.
- In the bottom part of the tool, select POST or GET, insert the destination
(in our case http://192.168.2.2:9000) and hit Send. In the console, you will see
delivered messages receipts

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your
application up and running.
